Never Not - Lauv
#002
We were so beautiful
We were so tragic #010
No other magic could ever compare
Lost myself seventeen #020
Then you came found me
No other magic could ever compare #030
There's a room
In my heart with the memories we made #035
Took 'em down but they're still in their frames
There's no way I could ever forget  #043
For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you #053
You 
I will never not think about you #100
From the moment I loved 
I knew you were the one #103
And no matter what I I do ooh 
I will never not think about you #115
What we had only comes
Once in a lifetime #123
For the rest of mine always compare
To the room #130
In my heart with the memories we made
Nights on fifth inbetween B and A #138
There's no way I could ever forget 
For as long as I live and as long as I love #148
I will never not think about you
You  #153
I will never not think about you
From the moment I loved  #200
I knew you were the one
And no matter what I I do ooh  #208
I will never not think about you
Didn't we have fun? #216
Didn't we have fun looking back?
Didn't we have fun? #223
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun? #230
Didn't we have fun looking back?
Didn't we have fun? #237
Didn't we have fun?
We were so beautiful #248
We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare #300
